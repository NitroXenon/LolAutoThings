send chat message?
1. easier: search for "ChatSend", go inside the callback provided, and there should be a call to send_chat
2. if 1 not possible: bp on RiotLauncher!MaestroGameController_SendChatMessage, go up a several functions and you're there

FloatingText
put a hardware breakpoint on "Level Up!"

main_loop
search for "GAMESTATE_GAMELOOP" string

CastSpell (check calling convention)
search for "ERROR: Client Tried to cast a spell from an invalid slot: %d."

AttackMove
the cursor xzy is stored in memory. after it there is the xzy of the last click.
hardware bp there and see who changes it. should be close to AttackMove (no need to go up the stack, should be in the same function
it breaks on)
